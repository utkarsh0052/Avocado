##Avocado Price Prediction
The data is made up of 2015-2018 retail scan data for national retail volume (units) and price for avacados. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. The Problem Here we want to use some or all of the features in this dataset to predict avocado price.
